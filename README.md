# nms-twitch-rewards
Because it's en vogue, because it's great for exposure, Hello Games thought it wise to begin a sporatic campaign of "Twitch Drops". There are a number of problems with this.
* Some people won't interact with Twitch because it's owned by Amazon, one of the scummiest corporations around.
* Some people won't interact with Twitch because of various complaints or protests about "streamer culture" in general.
* Some people CAN'T interact with Twitch because it's blocked by their ISPs or their country's government.
Whatever the reason, these are tangible rewards, and it's unfair to withhold these rewards from those that won't or can't watch some rando play the game that the watcher should be playing.

That's where this repo and its associated guide come in.

This repository aims to collect and distribute the exported JSON of all "generated" Twitch Drops for No Man's Sky.

This repo is a companion to the Steam guide found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2609669312
